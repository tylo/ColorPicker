A simplistic camera prefab that allows for a top-down view that can continuously pan based on a target, or pan based on a screen by screen basis. It comes with a custom inspector for those of you interested in the very basics of this process.

## Usage:
1. Drag and drop the "ColorPicker" prefab into your scene.
2. Bring up the inspector for the ColorPicker.
3. Set the "Loc X" and "Loc Y" variables to the coordinates you would like the Color Picker to appear on the screen.
4. Add "hooks" to the Color Picker in your GUI code (see Demo Scene and GUIExample.cs on how to accomplish this)
